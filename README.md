# LinearRegPy

LinearRegPy is a Python project that implements linear regression for predicting data trends using popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Overview

Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This project focuses on implementing linear regression in Python, specifically for predicting trends in datasets.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The project includes functionality for reading CSV data files into pandas DataFrames, shuffling the data, and splitting it into training and test sets.
- **Model Training:** Linear regression is performed using the least squares method to find the coefficients of the fitted line.
- **Visualization:** The project visualizes the original data points, the fitted line, and provides insights into the model's performance using matplotlib.
- **Error Calculation:** The error between the estimated values and the actual test data values is calculated and displayed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alireza-nasirian/LinearRegPy.git
    ```

2. Replace the `data.csv` file with your own dataset if necessary.

3. Run the `linear_regression.py` script:

    ```bash
    python linear_regression.py
    ```
